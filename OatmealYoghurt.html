                     Those days I crave something delicious, sweet, fresh, but diet friendly.  
                     If you feel like me, I know exactly what you need: Oatmeal with yoghurt and berries. 
                     Delicious, sweet, fresh and diet friendlyâ€¦
                     Bonus it is also super healthy.  </p>

                <div id="recipe-make">
                  <p>Put yoghurt in a bowl and add oatmeal. Mix them well and set aside in the fridge for 30 minutes. When the mixture has a thicker consistency, add your favourite berries on it, which are strawberries and blueberries for me. </p>
                  <p>Sprinkle some cinnamon and walnut pieces. It is that easy to prepare such a delicious, sweet, fresh, healthy and diet friendly breakfast. Hope you like it.</p>
