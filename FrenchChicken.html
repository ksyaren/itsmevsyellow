                  <p>Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Pour olive oil into the pan and seal the chickens for 8 or 9 minutes. Take the sealed chickens aside, put the julienned onions, bay leaf, rosemary and sliced garlic into the same pot and sauté for a while. Then add the mushrooms and cook well. </p>
                  <p>Remember removing bay leaves before adding soda. Put the chickens back in the pot and fill them with water until it’s just over them. Cook for 10 minutes with the lid closed and 20 minutes with the lid open. (If you like, you may add extra salt and pepper at this stage.) Take the chickens out of the pot. Mix the flour and yogurt in a bowl.</p>
                  <p>Temper the yogurt with the water in the pot. Gently pour the tempered yogurt into the pot. Then put the chicken drumsticks back, add the chopped parsley on them and cook for another 5 minutes to thicken the sauce. Bon appetite!</p>
