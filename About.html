                    <p>I love eating. Actually, I'm in love with it. I love eating everything that tastes nice. </p>
            <p>At first, I enjoyed trying, eating, cooking and baking only delicious but sweet recipes.</p>
        <p> Over time, I've realized that tasting nice doesn't mean eating nice.</p>
    <p>However, eating nicely is not something we can easily get in this life, just like a happy life.</p>
<p>When I've realized I want both of them, my cooking journey has begun!
            </p>
            <p>Now I'm cooking as I like, which makes me feel free.</p>
                <p>The recipes that I try and share with you will be tasty, healthy and delicious; I promise.</p>
                <p>Hoping you enjoy every single one of them as much as I do.</p>
            <p>After all, we all want the same thing: eat nicely, live happily, feel free. </p>
