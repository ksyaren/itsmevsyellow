## REQUIERMENTS
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- XAMPP
- MySQL
- Visual Studio Code

## PROCESS
First of all, I started by preparing the building blocks of the site with html, then I customized the appearance of the building blocks I created with css as I wanted. I used multiple html pages in the project and customized these pages with css. I provided the database required for the Contact section with mysql and used apache as the server. Then I converted the files I saved as html to php and added php codes to the html files for details.

## XAMPP
XAMPP stands for "Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB/MySQL (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P)." It is a free and open-source software package designed for web developers and individuals who need a web server environment on their computer. XAMPP allows you to easily set up a web server on your computer for developing and testing web applications.

### AS A CONCLUSION
