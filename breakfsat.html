                    <h2 id="salad-make">ðŸ”† Purslane Salad with carrots</h2>
                  <p>Cut mushrooms into four pieces and dice the carrot. Put them in a bowl and season them as you wish. </p>
                  <p>I prefer salt, pepper and cajun. Pour just a little bit oil on them. Then bake them in the airfryer at 180C for 10-15 minutes. </p>
                  <p>When they are ready, mitt them with the purslane you have prepared.</p>
                  <h2 id="egg-make">ðŸ”† Egg with tomato</h2>
                  <p>Separate the egg white and yolk. Let's add a little salt to the white part and bring it to a foamy consistency. Then add the egg yolks little by little and mix without extinguishing. </p>
                  <p>Chop the tomatoes into thin rounds on one side. Drizzle olive oil in a pan and place the tomatoes on it. After sprinkling the spices and adding our garlic, let's cook a little so that the tomatoes release themselves. </p>
                  <p>Let's put the egg mixture on the tomatoes and spread it in a nice thick layer. Cover and wait until the bottom is cooked. Then turn it over and fry the other side. Wow! That's it</p>
                 <h2 id="cheese-make">ðŸ”† Basil Curd Cheese </h2>
                 <p>Put the curd cheese, cream cheese and basil leaves in the blender</p>
                 <p>Slowly pour the milk into the mixture until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>
                 <p>ou can store it in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>
